# Verita API — Implementation Progress

Living log, one section per phase. Read the relevant phase section before
picking up work — each one carries the decisions/deviations made while
building it, not just a checklist.

---

## Phase 0 — Project Init & Setup ✅ Complete

**Repo:** `verita-api` (Laravel). Part of a 3-repo split: `verita-api`,
`verita-vue`, `verita-bruno` (Bruno collection — API docs + seeding tables
that depend on a runtime-created `Case` and can't go through factories).

**Global conventions locked in this phase:**
- All primary keys are **UUIDs**, not auto-increment integers.
- All auth guards (staff `api` guard + the future anonymous case guard) use **JWT**, not Sanctum.
- RFC 9457 problem-details envelope for all `api/*` error responses.
- `Repository` classes own **only** `Cache::`/`Redis::` calls — Services write
  to Models directly via `DB::transaction()`. (Explicitly rejected
  `manchenkoff/laravel-repositories` — its generic Eloquent-CRUD `Repository`
  concept conflicts with this convention; also archived upstream.)

**Delivered:**
- Folder scaffolding: `Data`, `Enums`, `Events`, `Listeners`, `Mail`,
  `Notifications`, `Policies`, `Repositories`, `V1` subfolders under
  Controllers/Requests/Resources.
- PostgreSQL connected (`migrate` runs clean).
- Redis wired for both cache and queue (Predis client).
- JWT (`tymon/jwt-auth`) installed, `api` guard added to `config/auth.php`,
  `User` implements `JWTSubject`. Full login round-trip not provable yet —
  `User` has no real fields until Phase 1.
- RFC 9457 exception envelope wired in `bootstrap/app.php`
  (`withExceptions()`), scoped to `api/*` only via `$request->is('api/*')`
  guard in each renderer. Verified against a 404.
- `v1` route prefix in place (`routes/api.php`).
- Named rate limiters defined but **not yet attached** to any route:
  `login` (5/min), `case-submit` (3/min), `pin-verify` (10/min). Attachment
  happens per-route in the phase that builds each one.
- `EnforceJson` middleware added (forces `Accept: application/json` on every
  request), registered globally on the `api` middleware group. **Not in the
  original plan doc — added mid-Phase-0.**
- Idempotency middleware (`EnsureIdempotency`) + `IdempotencyRepository`
  scaffolded as empty pass-throughs. Real logic lands in Phase 6 (Submit
  Case).
- Reverb installed and broadcasting route confirmed
  (`POST /broadcasting/auth`).
- Gmail SMTP wired; `MAIL_MAILER=log` for local dev (per convention — real
  sends only during Phase 12), one-off real SMTP send confirmed working.
- Gemini service (`app/Services/GeminiService.php`) built on Laravel's
  `Http` facade, **not Guzzle directly** — chosen for `Http::fake()`
  testability, since Phase 6's AI-failure-handling tests will need to mock
  Gemini without hitting the network. API key passed as query param, not
  header. `ping()` round-trip confirmed.
- Pest installed via `./vendor/bin/pest --init` (not `artisan pest:install`
  — that command doesn't exist in current Pest versions). Default example
  test passes.

**Gotchas hit, for the record:**
- Reverb threw `Pusher\Pusher::__construct(): $auth_key must be string, null
  given` after install — caused by a stale config cache serving pre-Reverb
  `.env`. Fixed with `php artisan config:clear`.
- Gemini model string: plan assumed `gemini-3.8-flash`, actually used
  `gemini-3.5-flash` (3.8 was over capacity at test time).
  `config/services.php` default updated to match.

**Flagged, not yet actioned:**
- Gemini's `thoughtsTokenCount` was 137 for a 2-word test answer — this
  model thinks by default. Worth capping via
  `generationConfig.thinkingConfig.thinkingBudget` once Phase 6 sends real
  case-structuring prompts. Cost/latency concern, not a blocker.

## Phase 1 — Models, Migrations, Seeding ✅ Complete

**Delivered:**
- 10 PHP backed enums (`app/Enums/`): `Role`, `PresenceStatus`, `CaseCategory`,
  `CaseStatus`, `SenderType`, `NotificationChannel`, `NotificationStatus`,
  `AuditActorType`, `AuditAction`, `EvidenceFileType`. Backed values match the
  master spec's exact vocabulary (`FRAUD`, `AWAITING_REVIEW`, etc.) so DB rows,
  API JSON, and spec text stay in sync.
- 7 migrations: `departments`, `users`, `case_records`, `evidences`, `messages`,
  `notifications`, `audit_logs`. All UUID PKs, generated at the model layer via
  Laravel's built-in `HasUuids` trait — no DB-level UUID default, no dependency
  on `pgcrypto`/`uuid-ossp`.
- 7 models + `User`, all relations per master spec §6.2 wired
  (`Department`, `User`, `CaseRecord`, `Evidence`, `Message`, `Notification`,
  `AuditLog`).
- Factories for all 7 models (`UserFactory` has `manager()`/`departmentHead()`
  states).
- `DatabaseSeeder`: 3 departments, 2 department heads each, 1 manager, 1 demo
  case (`AWAITING_REVIEW`) with evidence/messages/audit log attached.

**Deviations from the plan doc / master spec, both forced:**
- **`Case` → `CaseRecord` (class), table `case_records`.** `case` is a PHP
  reserved word (`switch`/`enum` syntax) — `class Case` is a parse error, not
  a style choice. `InvestigationCase` was rejected in an earlier pass and the
  master spec explicitly forbids reintroducing it, so `CaseRecord` was picked
  instead. Table name follows Eloquent's default convention from the class
  name (`case_records`) — no `$table` override needed. Every route, URL, and
  UI-facing string still says "Case"; this is a PHP-identifier-only deviation.
- **`Notification.status`** implemented as an enum (`UNREAD`/`READ`) rather
  than the master spec's undefined `status` attribute or a boolean
  `read_at` — the spec never enumerated its values, this was a session
  decision.
- **`AuditLog.timestamp` (spec name) → column `logged_at`.** Same attribute,
  renamed at the schema level only — `timestamp` is an awkward column/query
  identifier in Eloquent.
- **`evidences`, `messages`, `notifications`, `audit_logs` have no
  `created_at`/`updated_at`** — `public $timestamps = false;` on those 4
  models. They're append-only records with their own spec-named instant
  (`uploaded_at`, `sent_at`, `logged_at`); a redundant `updated_at` would be
  noise. `departments`, `users`, `case_records` keep standard `timestamps()`
  since those rows do mutate.

**Flagged, not yet actioned:**
- `users.department_id` is nullable at the DB level (Managers have none), even
  though a Department Head must have one per the spec. That constraint isn't
  enforced by the schema — it's a Phase 2 application-validation job (Form
  Request / Policy), not a DB-level rule.

## Phase 2 - Authenticate & Account Foundation
 (In progress)
